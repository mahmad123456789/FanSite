He began taking gaming more seriously starting with Mario Kart Wii, where he achieved the maximum rank at only 8 years of age.From there, Boomie transitioned to PC gaming, playing League of Legends and Rocket League, then eventually finding Brawlhalla after a friend's recommendation in late 2015. He traveled to his first event in 2016 where he placed 2nd, then afterwards, became near-unstoppable on LAN, never missing top 8 in 1v1s and only losing a single 2v2 tournament.</p> <a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
