	<h2 class="Tips">Map Control</h2>
	<p>Most people underestimate map control in this game when it might be one of the biggest things in this game. When you have more map control, you can move more, use more weapons and gadgets and overall have an easier time knocking out your opponent!</p>
	<h2 class="Tips">Signatures and Light Attacks</h2>
	<p>The optimal amount of signatures to light attacks is somewhere around 1 to 5 meaning you should not use signatures more than once every six moves, this can vary though because some signatures are a lot better at being used a lot than others.</p>
	<h2 class="Tips">Ground Pounds</h2>
	<p>The best way to use ground pound is for edge guarding. A lot of people use it on ground enemies and that could often make them hit the ground and be stunned so the enemy can hit them.</p>
	<h2 class="Tips">Spacing</h2>
	<p>Spacing in this game can be a bit weird so make sure you get used to it by using the awesome training mode that can show you various things like hitboxes/hurtboxes. Once you are used to spacing then you will know when to dodge and attack.</p>
	<h2 class="Tips">Be Unpredictable</h2>
	<p>This game has a lot of importance on reading rather than reactions because moves are thrown out so fast. You mostly have to base your moves around predicting what your opponent will do and if your opponent is unpredictable then it is harder. Therefore you have to be unpredictable to win more.</p>
	<h2 class="Tips">Recovering To The Platform</h2>
	<p>When recovering to the platform after getting hit off, it is very important that you take a very calm and calculated approach. Rushing back is usually the worst way to recover and will get you knocked out more than not. Use the jump resets when you touch the side wall wisely and recover when a opening appears.
